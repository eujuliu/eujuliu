## Hello, I'm Julio üñê

Since I was a child, I have been passionate about technology and problem solving, and these were some of the reasons why in 2019 I started studying programming, most of my knowledge came through free content on YouTube and websites spread across the internet, but despite having started in 2019 my first personal project was only developed in 2021, since I started programming I try to learn new things daily.

My main skills are in developing JavaScript/TypeScript applications, I can build user interfaces with ReactJS or web applications with server-side rendering and generation of static websites with NextJS and for Android and IOS I can develop native applications with React Native. In the Backend I can create REST APIs, with Node.js and Express.js and connect to relational databases using some ORM or SQL, and also connect to NoSQL databases
