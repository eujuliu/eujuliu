## I'm Julio üñê

Hello, </br>
I'm Computer System Analysis student, since I'm a kid I'm fissured for technology and solve problems, I too like nature, because the pure air of the nature inspire me. In my free time I like to seat at my backyard and take a nap. Every day I study new things about techlogy, and other things that I'm interested.

With my currently knowledges I can develop JavaScript applications, for example build user interfaces based on UI components with React.js or Next.js for web applications with server-side rendering and generating static websites and for Android & IOS I can develop native applications with React Native. I'm currently learning about Backend, but I can do basic APIs with Node.js and integrate this APIs with MongoDB and PostgreSQL database.

All of my knowledges: </br>
HTML, CSS (SASS, styled-components, CSS Modules), JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, React Native, Node.js, REST API, MongoDB, SQL (PostgreSQL)
