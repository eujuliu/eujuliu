## Hello, I'm Julio 🖐

Hi, my name is Julio and I'm a Software Engineer. I have 3+ years in this area as a student and professional. My focus is on creating secure, scalable, and cost-efficient software systems. If your company needs this, then call me!

In my daily work, I like to use Node.js, TypeScript or JavaScript, PostgreSQL/MySQL when we have structured and relational data, and MongoDB or Cassandra when we need high availability or real-time processing. If I need a cache or fast operations, I like to use Redis. This is for Backend.

When we go to Frontend, I like to use TypeScript. Any framework is good for me (Astro, Vue.js, React.js, or Angular). I have more knowledge in React.js and Vue.js. For styling, I use SCSS, CSS, or Tailwind CSS, and I like to create websites with good accessibility, performance, and SEO.

About automated tests, this is the main thing that I do in all my current apps/websites/systems. I try to create at least Unit Tests and Integration Tests. For a JavaScript environment, I use Vitest or Jest. If it is for Frontend, then I use Storybook for my components.

In all my apps/websites/systems, I like to create CI/CD pipelines for tests, code lint, commit lint, and for deploying to the cloud. Not only that, all my projects are made for development productivity, so I like Docker Compose to speed up the process of starting a new project.

Oh, and by the way... my operating system is Arch Linux. I use Arch, btw. 😄
