## Hello, I'm Julio üñê

I am a self-taught programmer with a passion for technology and problem-solving. Since 2019, I have been honing my skills through free online resources and daily practice.

My expertise lies in developing JavaScript/TypeScript applications, including creating user interfaces with ReactJS, server-side rendered web applications with NextJS, and native applications for Android and IOS using React Native. I am also proficient in creating REST APIs with Node.js and Express.js, and I can develop APIs with Python, using frameworks such as Django or FastAPI. Additionally, I have experience working with relational databases using SQL or ORM and NoSQL databases.

I am seeking new opportunities to apply my skills and continue learning in a challenging and dynamic environment.
