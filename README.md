## Hello, I'm Julio 🖐

I'm a software engineer — or, if you prefer, a programmer, developer, code guy... the title doesn’t really matter. What matters is that I solve problems and build solutions.

I have over 4 years of experience in software development, including 2 years working professionally as part of a team. During this time, I’ve built and maintained several personal and professional projects, many of which are available on my GitHub.

My focus is on creating scalable, testable, and functional applications. I specialize in web development using frameworks like **React.js**, **Vue.js**, **Next.js**, and **Astro**, combined with **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**, building websites with strong **SEO**, **accessibility**, and **performance**. For mobile apps, I use **React Native**.

On the backend side, I work with **Node.js**, **GraphQL**, **Python**, **Golang**, **JavaScript**, and **TypeScript**. I apply concepts such as **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **Clean Architecture**, **Hexagonal Architecture**, and **Design Patterns** to build decoupled, scalable, and testable systems. I’m experienced with both relational (**PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**) and non-relational (**MongoDB**, **Redis**) databases. I also build microservices that communicate via message queues like **RabbitMQ**, **Apache Kafka**, or use **gRPC** over HTTP/2. Most of the time, I containerize and manage these applications with **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.

When it comes to infrastructure, I create CI/CD pipelines with **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, or **Tekton**, and I can deploy applications on **AWS**, **IBM Cloud**, **Azure**, **Digital Ocean**, or **Vercel** — using serverless functions, containers, **Kubernetes**, and **Docker**.

Oh, and by the way... my operating system is **Arch Linux**. I use Arch, btw. 😄
